    <p>Hello! My name is Maisela Madise, and I’m from South Africa.
       I’m currently studying software development, a field I’m passionate about because
       I enjoy solving problems and creating new things with technology. 
       Outside of my studies, I love spending time with my family—we often play games, 
       share stories, and create fun memories together. 
       Family time is very important to me. 
       I’m also learning to play a musical instrument, 
       which has been a fun and challenging experience.</p>
