    <p>Johannesburg, also known as Jo'burg or Joburg, is the largest city in South Africa and a major economic hub on the continent. It was founded during the gold rush of 1886 and is now known for its modern skyline, vibrant culture, and rich history. The city is home to important sites like the Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill, and it plays a key role in South Africaâ€™s business, media, and arts sectors.</p>
